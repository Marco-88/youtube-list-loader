# youtube-list-loader

It is an older project of mine that I just did for educational purposes. It is not meant to download videos from YouTube (even if it could).
You can use the code as you want, I just uploaded it to a public repository as part of representation of my skills for.
It is written in python using tkinter and [pytube](https://github.com/pytube/pytube).
